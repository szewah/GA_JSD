/*Create the function askPolitely that accepts a sentence as an argument.
If the last character of the sentence is a question mark, the question 
should end with the word "please?". 
If a question is already polite (meaning it already ends with "please") 
OR the sentence is not a question, â€‹return string argument without 
modification.*/
