// 99 BOTTLES OF BEER
// Write a script that prints the lyrics to "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" in the terminal
// Make sure your program can handle both singular and plural cases (i.e. both "99 bottles of beer" and "1 bottle of beer")
// Hint: you will want to use a for loop that starts at 99 and counts down to 0
