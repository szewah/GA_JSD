/*

Work with a partner to create a Dog constructor, which creates instances containing the following properties:

* name (string)
* species (string)
* foodsEaten (array)

And the following methods:

* eatSomething(food): takes the 'food' argument (passed as a string) and pushes it into the 'foodsEaten' array
* introduce: console.logs a string introducing itself, including its name, species, and what it has eaten.

Create 3 dogs total. Make sure all 3 dogs have all properties set and methods defined.

Exercise your dogs by retrieving their properties and using their methods. Practice using both syntaxes
for retrieving properties (dot notation and brackets).
